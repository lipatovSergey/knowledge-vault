## 2025-08-25 — PATCH /me (update non-sensitive user data)

**Feature goal:**  
Allow an authenticated user to update only their own non-sensitive data (currently only `name`).  
Updating email and password will be handled in separate endpoints with different logic.

**Contract:**  
- Route: `PATCH /me`  
- Auth: `requireAuth`  
- Updatable fields: `name`  
- Validation: Zod

### Development steps
1. Added Zod schema for validation:
   ```js
   userInfoPatch: z.object({
     name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
   })
	```

2. Wrote red tests:
   * 401 when no session cookie is provided
   * 400 when `name` is empty
   * 200 when the update is successful

3. Implemented minimal functionality:
   * **repository** — `updateUserName` method
   * **service** — use-case with user existence check
   * **controller** — calls service and returns result
   * **route** — `PATCH /me` with `requireAuth` and validation

### Bug and fix
* **Bug:** repository returned `updatedName.name`. If the user didn’t exist, it returned `null`, causing a `TypeError`.
* **Fix:** repository now returns the entire object. The `null` check was moved to the service, which throws `NotFoundError`.

### Result
* All tests pass.
* Update logic for `name` is isolated and matches the contract.
* Email and password updates will be implemented in separate routes.
