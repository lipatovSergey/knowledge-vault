## 2025-10-03 — Notes validation hardening

**Goal**  
Lock in the guardrails around note creation so the API rejects bad inputs before we move on to the read endpoints.

### What changed today

- Rounded out the integration suite for `POST /api/notes` with table-driven tests for empty or missing `title`/`content`, unauthorized access, and max-length violations (`title ≤ 120`, `content ≤ 2000`).
- Updated `note.validator.js` to include `.trim()` plus the new length caps, keeping error messages explicit about the limits.
- Confirmed the response contract for validation failures stays `{ message, errors }`, adjusting tests to assert structure rather than hard-coded strings so future copy tweaks stay safe.

### Why

- Negative coverage ensures malformed payloads never sneak into Mongo and clarifies how clients should recover.
- Centralized trimming/limits in the schema avoids duplicating sanitation logic across controllers.
- Structural assertions in tests protect the API contract while keeping wording flexible for UX changes.

### Next steps

- Add ownership-aware `GET /api/notes/:id` with `NotFound` vs `Forbidden` branching.
- Expand the test helpers to reduce duplication in future note endpoint suites (shared factory for auth agent, payload builders, etc.).
